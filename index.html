      <h1>Caterpillar to Butterfly</h1>
        <p>
            When a caterpillar enters its chrysalis, it dissolves itself, quite literally, into liquid. 
            In this state, what was a caterpillar and will be a butterfly is neither one nor the other, 
            it’s a sort of living soup. Within this living soup are the imaginal cells that will 
            catalyse its transformation into winged maturity. May the best among us, the most visionary,
            the most inclusive, be the imaginal cells — for now we are in the soup. <strong>The outcome of disasters 
            is not foreordained. It’s a conflict, one that takes place while things that were frozen, solid 
            and locked up have become open and fluid — full of both the best and worst possibilities.</strong> We 
            are both becalmed and in a state of profound change.
