    <h2>Basics</h2>

    * HTML or Hyper Text Markup Language

    * Elements => <opening_tag> + Content + </closing_tag>

    * Tags are case insensitive but lowercase tag name with double quote enclosed attribute values are the standard.

    * DOM or document object models structures document according to how Elements are layed out by developer.

    * Block-level elemnent e.g., <p> <div> and inline Elements e.g., <span> </span> <em> </em> <strong> </strong>

    * A new line always gets added to before and after a Block-level elemnent by default by the browser.

    * Element nesting; Inline elements inside Block Level elements not the other way around.

    * The tags have to open and close in a way that they are inside or outside one another.

    * Empty elemement; usally inserts or embed something in the document e.g., <input> <img>

    * Attribute and values; <tag attribute="values"></tag>
    
    * Anchor or 
        <a href="https://link.domain" title="site description will be shown on hover" target="_blank">Link Text</a>

    * boolean attibutes e.g., disabled, readonly, required

    * Use double or single quotes around attribute-values and be consistent with either style. 

    * To insert a special character inside quoted values or inside HTML, use HTML entities such as, 
        &apos; &quot; &lt; &gt; &amp;  etc. 

    * Anatomy of HTML document
        - <!DOCTYPE html> , it is needed to make everything else to work right.
        - <html> </html> it is the root element.
        - <head> <title> </title> </head>
        - <body> </body>

    * Sequence of white spaces gets reduced to a single whitespace by the HTML parser.

    * <!--HTML comments-->

    

    <h2>The head and metadata</h2>
    
    * Content of the head element is not shown on the web page rather it contains metadata (data about data) 
        of the whole html document.
    
    * HTML has a standard tag '<meta name="meta_name" content="meta_content">' to add metadata.

    * <meta charset="utf-8"> this meta data specifies default character encoding for current web page.
        though browsers like chrome can automatically correct incorrect character encoding but it is good
        practice to add proper character encoding to ensure intended rendering.

    * Title of <title>The whole html document</title> not the document content; it also appears in search engine results.

    * You should use at most one <h1>Web page Heading</h1> to specify the heading for the document content.
    
    * <html lang="en-US"></html> specifies the default language for the html documnet and search engine indexing.

    * <span lang="en-US">Content</span> specifies default language for the 'spanned Content'

    * <meta name="author" content="Protick Roy">

    * <meta name="description" content="Description and high ranked keywords about the web page and its contents">
        appears in search engine results.

    * <meta name="keywords" content="keywords that relates to html the document"> ignored by search engine. 

    * facebook open-graph api and twitter cards metadata can be added to document head so that if anyone
        shares the link of a page of your website it will be displayed according to provided information in 
        custom meta data. 
    
    * You can also set your desired site links in google web master tools and such in other search engine so that 
        site links will be shown properly in search results. 
    
    * <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon"> to add favorites icon; use image icon with .ico
        format so that it is supported by all browsers and upto IE6.
        though every other major browser supports favicon with png or jpg or gif formats as well.
        
        Favicon size is 16x16 px.
        
        <!-- third-generation iPad with high-resolution Retina display: -->
        <link rel="apple-touch-icon-precomposed" sizes="144x144" 
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/static/img/favicon144.png">    
        (copied from Mozilla Developer network)

        The title and favicon is used when bookmarking a page. 
    
    * link and script element should always go into the head section of the html document. 
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" type="text/css">

        <script src="script.js" type="text/javascript" defer> </script>
        use defer with script loading so that script doesn't execute before loading the whole html document. 
        there is also other script loading mechanism available. 


    
    <h2>HTML text fundamentals and Semantics</h2>
        One of HTML's main jobs is to give text structure and meaning (also known as semantics)
        so that a browser can display it correctly.
        Structured content makes the reading experience easier and more enjoyable.
        (MDN)

    * <p> Use paragraph element to respresent a paragraph </p>

    * <h1> Top Level Heading </h1> try to use at most once per page to set the page heading.

    * <h1></h1> to <h6></h6> there are total 6 levels of headings but try to use no more than 3 in a page
        and also maintain hierarchy such that level of heading is descending from h1 to h6
        search engines uses heading to optimize search results.
    
    * Do not use semantic elements such as <p></p> <h1></h1>...<H6></H6> <strong></strong> <em></em> etc. to style
        the content rather use non semantic <span></span> <i></i> <b></b> and style with css.

    * Unordered lists
        <ul> 
            <li></li>
        </ul>
    
    * Ordered lists
        <ol>
            <li></li>
        </ol>
    
    * Nested lists
        <ul>
            <li></li>
            <li>
                <ol>
                    <li></li>
                    <li></li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
    
    * Description lists
        <dl>
            <dt>Terms</dt>
            <dd>Description</dd>
            <dd></dd>
            <dt>Color</dt>
            <dd>Green</dd>
            <dd>Blue</dd>
        </dl>
        Single term can have multiple descriptions. 
    
    * Emphasis <em></em>, stresses (streches) a word to give it a sarcastic meaning or a subtly different meaning to a word. 
        makes enclosed content italic, read in a different voice by screen reader.

    * Strong Importance <strong></strong>
        stresses a word, marks words of strong importance
        makes enclosed content bold, read in a different voice by screen reader. 

        <strong>You may<em>die</em></strong>; can be nested
    
    * Presentational Elements such as <i></i> <u></u> <b></b> were being used to make text italic, underline or bold 
        when CSS was not supported properly by all browsers. We should avoid using Presentational 
        Elements as we know semantics
        and accessibility is much more important.

        HTML5 redefined these elements and added semantic meaning.
        
        <i></i>
            mark up taxonomic designations: "I like <i>R. norvegicus</i>."
            mark up a phrase in a different language compared to the surrounding text: <i lang="es">À la carte</i>
            mark up a word when you talk about the word itself: " <i>drink</i> is both a noun and a verb

        <b></b>
            b should be used to mark up content that need to be easy to find in the text, like keywords. 
            I also use b as headings in list items (LIs).
            bold face element or bring attention to element. 

        <u></u>
            is used to convey a meaning traditionally conveyed by underline: proper name, misspelling...
            As hyperlinks often have underlines and u also applies underline to the content, consider applying 
            extra styles to denote spellings error or other styling as appropriate
            <u class="wrong-spelling">Some misspeled word</u>
            .wrong-spelling{
                text-decoration: red wavy underline;
            };

    * <dfn>definition tag</dfn>
        <p>A <dfn id="def-validator">validator</dfn> is a program that checks for syntax errors in code or documents.</p>
        you can nest dfn with links, abbr and such.

    <h2>Hyperlinks</h2>
        A URL can point to HTML files, text files, images, text documents, video and audio files or 
        anything else that lives on the web.
        
        * <a href="google.com" title="The popular search engine of the World Wide Web">Goggle Homepage</a>
            link title is not available to the keyboard and touchscreen users so if the link text is 
            so important to usability place it 
            regular text.
        
        * block level link 
            <a href="mozilla.com" target="_blank">
                <img src="assignment\mozilla_splash_page\originals\firefox_logo-only_RGB-120.png" alt="mozilla logo" title="a curled up firey fox that represents mozilla firefox logo">
            </a>
        
        * index.html inside root directory (container directory) is entry point of a website.
            One project can have multiple index.html but in different file-system directories. 

        * Document fragments: mark part of html document in a element and give it a unique id and use that id to 
            navigate within that page. 
            <a href="contacts.html#mailing_list"> Mailing List </a>

        * Relative to current file and Absolute same from everywhere URL 
        
        * Link Best Practices
            Use contextual keywords that best describes what the link is pointing to. 
            Do not repeat the url as link text
            Do not say link or links as part of link text
            Keep your link text as short as possible 
            Minimize instances where multiple copies of same link text are linked to different places. 
            Use relative links whereever possible. 
            Use absolute url when linking to external website. 

        * Linking to non HTML resource
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.example.com/large-report.pdf">
                Download the sales report (PDF, 10MB)
                </a>
            </p>
          
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.example.com/video-stream/" target="_blank">
                    Watch the video (stream opens in separate tab, HD quality)
                </a>
            </p>
          
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.example.com/car-game">
                    Play the car game (requires Flash)
                </a>
             </p>

        * Use download attribute when linking to a download
            <p>
                <a href="https://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-latest-ssl&os=win64&lang=en-US"
                    download="firefox-latest-64bit-installer.exe">
                Download Latest Firefox for Windows (64-bit) (English, US)
                </a>
            </p>
            "download" attribute value provides default save filename for the download. 
        
        * Email links
            <a href="mailto:nowhere@mozilla.org">Send email to nowhere</a>

            <a href="mailto:nowhere@mozilla.org?cc=name2@rapidtables.com&bcc=name3@rapidtables.com&subject=The%20subject%20of%20the%20email&body=The%20body%20of%20the%20email">
                Send mail with cc, bcc, subject and body
            </a>

            the value of each field should be URL encoded for non printing characters like tabs spaces carriage returns 
            with percent escaped values. 

    <h2>Advanced Text Formatting</h2>
        * Quotations
            - Block Level Quotations
                If a section of block level content (paragraphs, lists, etc.) is quoted from anywhere else 
                you should wrap it
                inside  <Blockquote>  </Blockquote> and specify the source with the "cite" attribute and value. 

            - Inline Quotations
                quote an inline element with <q cite="source"></q>
            
            - <cite>The name of the Source/ Book name</cite> , element is also available but it is impossible to show the 
                show as browswers doesn't show it.

    <h2>Document and website structure</h2>
        HTML also has a number of block level elements to define areas of a website
        
        * Header 
            A big strip across the top of a webpage with big heading, logo and perhaps a tagline.
            <header> </header>

        * Navbar 
            A list of links to site's main location, like header this page should remain consistent across webpages.
            Some prefers it to be a part of the header and some argues header and navbar should remain separate for 
            better accessibility. 
            <nav></nav>

        * Main content 
            A big area in the center that contains most of the unique content of a given webpage. 
            <main>
                <article></article>
                <section></section>
            </main>

        * Sidebar 
            Some peripheral info, links, authors bio, ads, secondary navigation system. This is contextual to main content.
            <aside></aside>

        * Footer
            A strip across bottom of a webpage that contains fine print, contact info, copyright notices. 
            It is also used for placing common but secondary links and SEO purposes by providing links to popular 
            content of the website. 
            <footer></footer>
        
        * Element details

            <main> is for content unique to this page. Use <main> only once per page, and put it directly inside <body>. 
                Ideally this shouldn't be nested within other elements.

            <article> encloses a block of related content 
                that makes sense on its own without the rest of the page (e.g., a single blog post).
                
            <section> is similar to <article>, but it is more for grouping together a single part of the page 
                that constitutes one single piece of functionality (e.g., a mini map, or a set of article headlines 
                and summaries), 
                or a theme. It's considered best practice to begin each section with a heading; 
                also note that you can break <article>s up into different <section>s, or 
                <section>s up into different <article>s, depending on the context.
                    
            <aside> contains content that is not directly related to the main content but 
                can provide additional information indirectly related to it (glossary entries, author biography, 
                related links, etc.).

            <header> represents a group of introductory content. 
                If it is a child of <body> it defines the global header of a webpage, but 
                if it's a child of an <article> or <section> it defines a specific header for that section.

            <nav> contains the main navigation functionality for the page. Secondary links, etc., would not go in the 
                navigation.

            <footer> represents a group of end content for a page.

        * Example

        <!--
            <!DOCTYPE html>

        * Non-Semantic wrapper elements 
            - <span class="class-name"  ></span> is an inline non semantic wrapper element. 
                peripheral info related to content but not to the context. 
                like lighting info of a theater scene. 

            - <div class="shopping-cart">
                <h2>Shopping Cart</h2>
              </div> is an non-semantic block level element, 
              Not related to context of main so aside element is not appropriate. 
              Not a part of the main content so section element is not appropriate. 
              Heading is used so that screen readers can find it easily.
        
        * Line breaks
            <br> creates a line break in a paragraph, can be used in a poem
        
        * Horizontal Rule
            <hr> creates a horizontal black strip that denotes thematic change in text such as topic or scene.
            
    <h2>Planning a Website</h2>
        Arrange information for better accessibility; Information architecture 

        * List down content that are common to every page of your website e.g., header, nav, footer 
        * List down content that are different for every page 
        * Figure out what your website should look like 
        * Group content in different groups; card sorting
        * Now draw relation aka sitemap between different groups (different pages) 
    
    <h2>Images in HTML</h2>
        * <img 
            src="absolute/or/relative/path/to/image.ext" 
            alt="whats in the image ?" 
            title="what extra information best describes the image ?"
            >

        * Image file name also used in SEO so use meaningful descriptive filename for images

        * Do not use img element for decorative background images, use css and if you must then add image with 
            empty alt text. 

        * Alt text is also important for seo. 
        
        * Width and height attribute provide values that will be used to leave space for image until its loaded

        * Annotate figure with figure and figcaption
              <figure>
                  <img src="" alt="">
                  <figcaption>A Blank space for a image</figcaption>
              </figure>

        * if you need to alter image size use css, keep aspect ratio.

        * A figure could be several images, a code snippet, audio, video, equations, a table, or something else. 

        * If an image has meaning, in terms of your content, you should use an HTML image. 
            If an image is purely decoration, you should use CSS background images.
        
        * Hotlinking is illeagal and slows down your webpage.

        * Use tinypng to compress image for faster page load. 

    <h2>HTML Debugging</h2>
        HTML is permissive markup language, meaning even if you make mistakes in your syntax and structure it will 
        show the webpage but not the way you expected.

        * Use w3c / World Wide Web Consortium's HTML validator to find out syntax error and probable solution to them. 


    <h2>Video and Audio</h2>
        Online Video Providers such as youtube, vimeo, dailymotion etc and audio providers like soundcloud 
        can be used to embed video and audios to your webpage. 

        * <video src="path/to/video.ext" controls>
            <p>A fallback text if video could not be loaded or played by the browser</p>
        </video>

        Formats like MP3, MP4 and WebM are called container formats. 
        They define a structure in which the audio and/or video tracks 
        that make up the media are stored, along with metadata describing the media, 
        what codecs are used to encode its channels, and so forth.
        (MDN)

        ensure support for all browsers by providing different source with different formats. 

        * <video controls>
            <source src="path/to/video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            <source src="path/to/video.webm" type="video/webm"> 
            <p>A fallback text if video could not be loaded or played by the browser</p>
          </video>
          
          you should specify a MIME type (aka media type or content type) for faster media loading.

        *   <video controls width="400" height="400"
                autoplay loop muted preload="auto"
                poster="poster.png">
                <source src="rabbit320.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                <source src="rabbit320.webm" type="video/webm">
                <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML video. Here is a 
                    <a href="rabbit320.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.
                </p>
            </video>
        
            width and height
            You can control the video size either with these attributes or with CSS. In both cases, 
            videos maintain their native width-height ratio — known as the aspect ratio. If the aspect ratio 
            is not maintained by the sizes you set, the video will grow to fill the space horizontally, 
            and the unfilled space will just be given a solid background color by default.

            autoplay
            Makes the audio or video start playing right away, while the rest of the page is loading. 
            You are advised not to use autoplaying video (or audio) on your sites, because users can find it 
            really annoying.

            loop
            Makes the video (or audio) start playing again whenever it finishes. This can also be annoying, 
            so only use if really necessary.

            muted
            Causes the media to play with the sound turned off by default.

            poster
            The URL of an image which will be displayed before the video is played. 
            It is intended to be used for a splash screen or advertising screen.

            preload
            Used for buffering large files; it can take one of three values:
            "none" does not buffer the file
            "auto" buffers the media file
            "metadata" buffers only the metadata for the file

        * Audio
            <audio controls>
                <source src="viper.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
                <source src="viper.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
                <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 audio. Here is a <a href="viper.mp3">link to the audio</a> instead.</p>
            </audio>
            
            audio supports same features as video except for features that impart visual elements. 
        
        * Video Text tracks
        
        <track> element and WebVTT format. 
        
        "Transcribe" means "to write down spoken words as text." The resulting text is a "transcript." 

        WebVTT is a format for writing text files containing multiple strings of text along with metadata 
        such as the time in the video at which each text string should be displayed, 
        and even limited styling/positioning information. These text strings are called cues, 
        and there are several kinds of cues which are used for different purposes. The most common cues are:
        
        subtitles
            Translations of foreign material, for people who don't understand the words spoken in the audio.
        
        captions
            Synchronized transcriptions of dialog or descriptions of significant sounds, 
        to let people who can't hear the audio understand what is going on.
        
        timed descriptions
            Text which should be spoken by the media player in order to describe important visuals to 
        blind or otherwise visually impaired users.

        (Mozilla Developer Network)
    
        <video controls>
            <source src="example.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            <source src="example.webm" type="video/webm">
            <track kind="subtitles" src="subtitles_es.vtt" srclang="es" label="Spanish" default>
            <track label="Deutsch" kind="subtitles" srclang="de" src="captions/vtt/sintel-de.vtt">
            <track label="Español" kind="subtitles" srclang="es" src="captions/vtt/sintel-es.vtt">
        </video>
        
        Text tracks also help you with SEO, since search engines especially thrive on text. 
        Text tracks even allow search engines to link directly to a spot partway through the video.

    <h2>Other Embedding technologies</h2>
        * <iframe> </iframe> element used for embedding other web documents into current document. 

        *   <iframe src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary"
                width="100%" height="500" allowfullscreen sandbox>
                <p>
                    <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary">
                    Fallback link for browsers that don't support iframes
                    </a>
                </p>
            </iframe>
            
        * In order to improve speed, it's a good idea to set the iframe's src attribute with JavaScript 
            after the main content is done with loading. This makes your page usable sooner and decreases 
            your official page load time (an important SEO metric.)
        
        * Security Concerns
            - Clickjacking is one kind of common iframe attack where hackers embed an invisible iframe into your document 
                (or embed your document into their own malicious website) and use it to capture users' interactions. 
                This is a common way to mislead users or steal sensitive data.

                to prevent this you can set server option X-Frame to DENY  and set CSP directives. 
            
            - Embed only when necessary and use https

            - One important note is that you should never add both allow-scripts and allow-same-origin to your 
                sandbox attribute — in that case, the embedded content could bypass the Same-origin policy 
                that stops sites from executing scripts, and use JavaScript to turn off sandboxing altogether.
            
            - If there's any chance that certain content may be malicious (e.g., user-generated content), 
                please serve it from a different domain to your main site.

        * <object data="url/source" type="mime type"></object> and <embed src="url/source" type="mime type"> 
                are general purpose embedding tools for embedding multiple types of external contet plugin, 
                flash, pdf, videos and SVGs etc. Plugins and these embedding methods are really a legacy technology
            
            - e.g., 
                <embed src="whoosh.swf" quality="medium"
                bgcolor="#ffffff" width="550" height="400"
                name="whoosh" align="middle" allowScriptAccess="sameDomain"
                allowFullScreen="false" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"
                pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer">
            
                <object data="mypdf.pdf" type="application/pdf"
                    width="800" height="1200">
                    <p>You don't have a PDF plugin, but you can
                        <a href="mypdf.pdf">download the PDF file.
                        </a>
                    </p>
                </object>
            
        *  It is much better to link to pdf so they can be downloaded or read on a separate page, 
            rather than embedding them in a webpage.
        
    <h2>Adding Vector Grphics to the Web</h2>

        * Raster images are defined using a grid of pixels — a raster image file contains information showing exactly where each pixel is to be placed, 
            and exactly what color it should be. Popular web raster formats include Bitmap (.bmp), PNG (.png), JPEG (.jpg), and GIF (.gif.)
    
        * Vector images are defined using algorithms — a vector image file contains shape and path definitions that 
            the computer can use to work out what the image should look like when rendered on the screen. 
            The SVG format allows us to create powerful vector graphics for use on the Web.
    
        * SVG is an XML-based language for describing vector images. It's basically markup, like HTML, except that you've got 
            many different elements for defining the shapes you want to appear in your image, 
            and the effects you want to apply to those shapes. SVG is for marking up graphics, not content.

        At the simplest end of the spectrum, you've got elements for creating simple shapes, like <circle> and <rect>. 
            More advanced SVG features include <feColorMatrix> (transform colors using a transformation matrix,) 
            <animate> (animate parts of your vector graphic,) and <mask> (apply a mask over the top of your image.)
    
            - For creating SVG images, most people use a vector graphics editor like Inkscape or Illustrator.
    
        * SVG has some additional advantages besides those described so far:

            - Text in vector images remains accessible (which also benefits your SEO).
            - SVGs lend themselves well to styling/scripting, because each component of the image is an element 
                that can be styled via CSS or scripted via JavaScript.
        
            SVG does have some disadvantages:
        
            - SVG can get complicated very quickly, meaning that file sizes can grow; complex SVGs 
                can also take significant processing time in the browser.
            - SVG can be harder to create than raster images, depending on what kind of image you are trying to create.
            - SVG is not supported in older browsers, so may not be suitable if you need to support older 
                versions of Internet Explorer with your web site (SVG started being supported as of IE9.)
            - Raster graphics are arguably better for complex precision images such as photos, for the reasons described above.
    
        * You can add SVG into your HTML document by, 
            <img src=".png" alt="" srcset=".svg">
            
            or 

            <svg width="" height="" >
                <rect width="100%" height="100%" fill="green" /> 
            </svg>
        
        * You can also use SVGs as CSS background images, as shown below. In the below code, older 
            browsers will stick with the PNG that they understand, while newer browsers will load the SVG:

        - Resolution switching
            same image different resolution for different viewport

            The standard img element only lets us point browser to single source file. 


            adding two new attributes "srcset" and "sizes" to solve resolution switching problem.
            <img srcset="assignment/mozilla_splash_page/originals/firefox_logo-only_RGB-120.png 120w,
                        assignment/mozilla_splash_page/originals/firefox_logo-only_RGB-400.png 400w, 
                        assignment/mozilla_splash_page/originals/firefox_logo-only_RGB.png 1200w
                " 
                sizes=" (max-width: 400px) 120px, 
                        (max-width: 600px) 400px, 
                        1200px
                "

            src="assignment/mozilla_splash_page/originals/firefox_logo-only_RGB.png" 
            alt="A curled up fiery fox that represents mozilla firefox">

            Note: 

            srcset 
                defines the set of images we will allow the browser to choose between, and what size each image is.

            Each set of image information is separated from the previous one by a comma. For each one, we write:
                An image filename (elva-fairy-480w.jpg)
                A space
                The image's intrinsic width in pixels (480w) — note that this uses the w unit, 
                not px as you might expect. 
                This is the image's real size, which can be found by inspecting the image file on your computer (for example, 
                on a Mac you can select the image in Finder and press Cmd + I to bring up the info screen).

            sizes 
                defines a set of media conditions (e.g. screen widths) and indicates what image size 
                would be best to choose, when certain media conditions are true — these are the hints we 
                talked about earlier. In this case, before each comma we write:

                    A media condition ((max-width:600px)) — you'll learn more about these in the CSS topic, but for now let's just say that a media condition describes a possible state that the screen can be in. In this case, we are saying "when the viewport width is 600 pixels or less".
                    A space
                    The width of the slot the image will fill when the media condition is true (480px)

                    Note: For the slot width, you may provide an absolute length (px, em) or a 
                    length relative to the viewport (vw), but not percentages. 
                    You may have noticed that the last slot width has no media condition 
                    (this is the default that is chosen when none of the media conditions are true). 
                    The browser ignores everything after the first matching condition, so be careful how you order 
                    the media conditions.

            So, with these attributes in place, the browser will:
                Look at its device width.
                Work out which media condition in the sizes list is the first one to be true.
                Look at the slot size given to that media query.
                Load the image referenced in the srcset list that has the same size as the slot or, 
                if there isn't one, the first image that is bigger than the chosen slot size.
            
                * document.querySelector('html').clientWidth)
                * <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
                * about:debugging
            
            If you are supporting multiple display resolutions but the image is shown in same real-world size on the screen 
            then you can use x-descriptors with your image using srcset and without sizes attribute. 

            <img srcset="elva-fairy-320w.jpg,
                        elva-fairy-480w.jpg 1.5x,
                        elva-fairy-640w.jpg 2x"
                src="elva-fairy-640w.jpg"
                alt="Elva dressed as a fairy">

            same size on the screen but different pixel density 
            the x-descriptors defines device pixel density multiplier of one css pixel


        - Art direction
            different suitable image for different viewport

            <picture>
                <source media="(max-width: 799px)" srcset="elva-480w-close-portrait.jpg">
                <source media="(min-width: 800px)" srcset="elva-800w.jpg">
                <img src="elva-800w.jpg" alt="Chris standing up holding his daughter Elva">
              </picture>
              
            Note: You should use the media attribute only in art direction scenarios; 
            when you do use media, don't also offer media conditions within the sizes attribute. 
        
            New image formats like WebP and AVIF can maintain a low file size and high quality at the same time. 
            These formats now have relatively broad browser support but little "historical depth".

            <picture> </picture>
                lets us continue catering to older browsers. 
                You can supply MIME types inside type attributes so the browser can immediately reject unsupported file types:
            
            <picture>
              <source type="image/svg+xml" srcset="pyramid.svg">
              <source type="image/webp" srcset="pyramid.webp">
              <img src="pyramid.png" alt="regular pyramid built from four equilateral triangles">
            </picture>

            * Do not use the media attribute, unless you also need art direction.
            * In a <source> element, you can only refer to images of the type declared in type.
            * Use comma-separated lists with srcset and sizes, as needed.
