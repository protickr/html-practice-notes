    <h2>Basics</h2>

    * HTML or Hyper Text Markup Language

    * Elements => <opening_tag> + Content + </closing_tag>

    * Tags are case insensitive but lowercase tag name with double quote enclosed attribute values are the standard.

    * DOM or document object models structures document according to how Elements are layed out by developer.

    * Block-level elemnent e.g., <p> <div> and inline Elements e.g., <span> </span> <em> </em> <strong> </strong>

    * A new line always gets added to before and after a Block-level elemnent by default by the browser.

    * Element nesting; Inline elements inside Block Level elements not the other way around.

    * The tags have to open and close in a way that they are inside or outside one another.

    * Empty elemement; usally inserts or embed something in the document e.g., <input> <img>

    * Attribute and values; <tag attribute="values"></tag>
    
    * Anchor or 
        <a href="https://link.domain" title="site description will be shown on hover" target="_blank">Link Text</a>

    * boolean attibutes e.g., disabled, readonly, required

    * Use double or single quotes around attribute-values and be consistent with either style. 

    * To insert a special character inside quoted values or inside HTML, use HTML entities such as, 
        &apos; &quot; &lt; &gt; &amp;  etc. 

    * Anatomy of HTML document
        - <!DOCTYPE html> , it is needed to make everything else to work right.
        - <html> </html> it is the root element.
        - <head> <title> </title> </head>
        - <body> </body>

    * Sequence of white spaces gets reduced to a single whitespace by the HTML parser.

    * <!--HTML comments-->

    

    <h2>The head and metadata</h2>
    
    * Content of the head element is not shown on the web page rather it contains metadata (data about data) 
        of the whole html document.
    
    * HTML has a standard tag '<meta name="meta_name" content="meta_content">' to add metadata.

    * <meta charset="utf-8"> this meta data specifies default character encoding for current web page.
        though browsers like chrome can automatically correct incorrect character encoding but it is good
        practice to add proper character encoding to ensure intended rendering.

    * Title of <title>The whole html document</title> not the document content; it also appears in search engine results.

    * You should use at most one <h1>Web page Heading</h1> to specify the heading for the document content.
    
    * <html lang="en-US"></html> specifies the default language for the html documnet and search engine indexing.

    * <span lang="en-US">Content</span> specifies default language for the 'spanned Content'

    * <meta name="author" content="Protick Roy">

    * <meta name="description" content="Description and high ranked keywords about the web page and its contents">
        appears in search engine results.

    * <meta name="keywords" content="keywords that relates to html the document"> ignored by search engine. 

    * facebook open-graph api and twitter cards metadata can be added to document head so that if anyone
        shares the link of a page of your website it will be displayed according to provided information in 
        custom meta data. 
    
    * You can also set your desired site links in google web master tools and such in other search engine so that 
        site links will be shown properly in search results. 
    
    * <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon"> to add favorites icon; use image icon with .ico
        format so that it is supported by all browsers and upto IE6.
        though every other major browser supports favicon with png or jpg or gif formats as well.
        
        Favicon size is 16x16 px.
        
        <!-- third-generation iPad with high-resolution Retina display: -->
        <link rel="apple-touch-icon-precomposed" sizes="144x144" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/static/img/favicon144.png">    
        (copied from Mozilla Developer network)

        The title and favicon is used when bookmarking a page. 
    
    * link and script element should always go into the head section of the html document. 
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" type="text/css">

        <script src="script.js" type="text/javascript" defer> </script>
        use defer with script loading so that script doesn't execute before loading the whole html document. 
        there is also other script loading mechanism available. 


    
    <h2>HTML text fundamentals and Semantics</h2>
        One of HTML's main jobs is to give text structure and meaning (also known as semantics)
        so that a browser can display it correctly.
        Structured content makes the reading experience easier and more enjoyable.
        (MDN)

    * <p> Use paragraph element to respresent a paragraph </p>

    * <h1> Top Level Heading </h1> try to use at most once per page to set the page heading.

    * <h1></h1> to <h6></h6> there are total 6 levels of headings but try to use no more than 3 in a page
        and also maintain hierarchy such that level of heading is descending from h1 to h6
        search engines uses heading to optimize search results.
    
    * Do not use semantic elements such as <p></p> <h1></h1>...<H6></H6> <strong></strong> <em></em> etc. to style
        the content rather use non semantic <span></span> <i></i> <b></b> and style with css.

    * Unordered lists
        <ul> 
            <li></li>
        </ul>
    
    * Ordered lists
        <ol>
            <li></li>
        </ol>
    
    * Nested lists
        <ul>
            <li></li>
            <li>
                <ol>
                    <li></li>
                    <li></li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
    
    * Description lists
        <dl>
            <dt>Terms</dt>
            <dd>Description</dd>
            <dd></dd>
            <dt>Color</dt>
            <dd>Green</dd>
            <dd>Blue</dd>
        </dl>
        Single term can have multiple descriptions. 
    
    * Emphasis <em></em>, stresses (streches) a word to give it a sarcastic meaning or a subtly different meaning to a word. 
        makes enclosed content italic, read in a different voice by screen reader.

    * Strong Importance <strong></strong>
        stresses a word, marks words of strong importance
        makes enclosed content bold, read in a different voice by screen reader. 

        <strong>You may<em>die</em></strong>; can be nested
    
    * Presentational Elements such as <i></i> <u></u> <b></b> were being used to make text italic, underline or bold 
        when CSS was not supported properly by all browsers. We should avoid using Presentational Elements as we know semantics
        and accessibility is much more important.

        HTML5 redefined these elements and added semantic meaning.
        
        <i></i>
            mark up taxonomic designations: "I like <i>R. norvegicus</i>."
            mark up a phrase in a different language compared to the surrounding text: <i lang="es">Ã€ la carte</i>
            mark up a word when you talk about the word itself: " <i>drink</i> is both a noun and a verb

        <b></b>
            b should be used to mark up content that need to be easy to find in the text, like keywords. 
            I also use b as headings in list items (LIs).
            bold face element or bring attention to element. 

        <u></u>
            is used to convey a meaning traditionally conveyed by underline: proper name, misspelling...
            As hyperlinks often have underlines and u also applies underline to the content, consider applying 
            extra styles to denote spellings error or other styling as appropriate
            <u class="wrong-spelling">Some misspeled word</u>
            .wrong-spelling{
                text-decoration: red wavy underline;
            };

    * <dfn>definition tag</dfn>
        <p>A <dfn id="def-validator">validator</dfn> is a program that checks for syntax errors in code or documents.</p>
        you can nest dfn with links, abbr and such.

    <h2>Hyperlinks</h2>
        A URL can point to HTML files, text files, images, text documents, video and audio files or anything else that lives on the web.
        
        * <a href="google.com" title="The popular search engine of the World Wide Web">Goggle Homepage</a>
            link title is not available to the keyboard and touchscreen users so if the link text is so important to usability place it 
            regular text.
        
        * block level link 
            <a href="mozilla.com" target="_blank">
                <img src="assignment\mozilla_splash_page\originals\firefox_logo-only_RGB-120.png" alt="mozilla logo" title="a curled up firey fox that represents mozilla firefox logo">
            </a>
        
        * index.html inside root directory (container directory) is entry point of a website.
            One project can have multiple index.html but in different file-system directories. 

        * Document fragments: mark part of html document in a element and give it a unique id and use that id to 
            navigate within that page. 
            <a href="contacts.html#mailing_list"> Mailing List </a>

        * Relative to current file and Absolute same from everywhere URL 
        
        * Link Best Practices
            Use contextual keywords that best describes what the link is pointing to. 
            Do not repeat the url as link text
            Do not say link or links as part of link text
            Keep your link text as short as possible 
            Minimize instances where multiple copies of same link text are linked to different places. 
            Use relative links whereever possible. 
            Use absolute url when linking to external website. 

        * Linking to non HTML resource
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.example.com/large-report.pdf">
                Download the sales report (PDF, 10MB)
                </a>
            </p>
          
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.example.com/video-stream/" target="_blank">
                    Watch the video (stream opens in separate tab, HD quality)
                </a>
            </p>
          
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.example.com/car-game">
                    Play the car game (requires Flash)
                </a>
             </p>

        * Use download attribute when linking to a download
            <p>
                <a href="https://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-latest-ssl&os=win64&lang=en-US"
                    download="firefox-latest-64bit-installer.exe">
                Download Latest Firefox for Windows (64-bit) (English, US)
                </a>
            </p>
            "download" attribute value provides default save filename for the download. 
        
        * Email links
            <a href="mailto:nowhere@mozilla.org">Send email to nowhere</a>

            <a href="mailto:nowhere@mozilla.org?cc=name2@rapidtables.com&bcc=name3@rapidtables.com&subject=The%20subject%20of%20the%20email&body=The%20body%20of%20the%20email">
                Send mail with cc, bcc, subject and body
            </a>

            the value of each field should be URL encoded for non printing characters like tabs spaces carriage returns 
            with percent escaped values. 

    <h2>Advanced Text Formatting</h2>
        * Quotations
            - Block Level Quotations
                If a section of block level content (paragraphs, lists, etc.) is quoted from anywhere else you should wrap it
                inside  <Blockquote>  </Blockquote> and specify the source with the "cite" attribute and value. 

            - Inline Quotations
                quote an inline element with <q cite="source"></q>
            
            - <cite>The name of the Source/ Book name</cite> , element is also available but it is impossible to show the 
                show as browswers doesn't show it. 
            
            - workaround
                <p>According to the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote">
                    <cite>MDN blockquote page</cite></a>:

    <h2>Document and website structure</h2>
        HTML also has a number of block level elements to define areas of a website
        
        * Header 
            A big strip across the top of a webpage with big heading, logo and perhaps a tagline.

        * Navbar 
            A list of links to site's main location, like header this page should remain consistent across webpages.
            Some prefers it to be a part of the header and some argues header and navbar should remain separate for 
            better accessibility. 

        * Main content 
            A big area in the center that contains most of the unique content of a given webpage. 

        * Sidebar 
            Some peripheral info, links, authors bio, ads, secondary navigation system. This is contextual to main content.

        * Footer
            A strip across bottom of a webpage that contains fine print, contact info, copyright notices. 
            It is also used for placing common but secondary links and SEO purposes by providing links to popular 
            content of the website.
